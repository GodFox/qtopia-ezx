    \title Creating Custom Qt Types
    \ingroup architecture
    \brief How to create and register new types with Qt.

    \tableofcontents

    \section1 Overview

    When creating user interfaces with Qt, particularly those with specialized controls and
    features, developers sometimes need to create new data types that can be used alongside
    or in place of Qt's existing set of value types.

    Standard types such as QSize, QColor and QString can all be stored in QVariant objects,
    used as the types of properties in QObject-based classes, and emitted in signal-slot
    communication.
    In this document, we take a custom type and describe how to integrate it into Qt's object
    model so that it can be stored in the same way as standard Qt types. We then show how to
    register the custom type to allow it to be used in signals and slots connections.
