 * \brief  On RHEL4 having these functions inlined doesn't work.
 *    
 * The get_procnum() worked when inlined, but the get_proc() didn't.
 * That is why even tho' they are simple and non-virtual functions
 * they are non-inline.
 *
 * xxx aak: need to investigate further post-release why the inlining
 * of get_proc() causes CAs when used inside cloaking code.
