     The build system now supports "Classic" and&nbsp; "MacOS X" builds.
The<font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace"><small>   'BUILD_ON_PLATFORM'</small></font>
 environment variable defined in RMA Build Prefs  determines which type of
build is running. A MacOS X build uses the following  tools:<br>
     <br>
     CodeWarrior 7 or later<br>
     <a href="http://www.cwi.nl/%7Ejack/macpython.html">Python 2.2.2</a><br>
    <a href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/maccvspro/MacCVS_Pro_27d3.sit">
   MacCVS Pro 2.7d</a> &nbsp;&nbsp; (<a href="http://www.maccvs.org/download.html">
   MacCVS Pro 2.5</a> may also be used) <br>
     <br>
     <br>
     Copy OSAm.carbon.slb and StuffIt.carbon.slb from (....) to Python 2.2.2:Lib:site-packages:<br>
  <br>
     <br>
    Add the following environment variables to your RMA Build Prefs (under
OS  X, it resides in:&nbsp; user(you)/library/Preferences/)<br>
     <br>
    <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace"><small> 'BUILD_ON_PLATFORM'
  &nbsp; : 'MacOSX',<br>
     'COMPILER'&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
: 'mac-cw',<br>
     'COMPILER_VERSION'&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;: '7',<br>
     'TARGET_ARCHITECTURE' : 'mac-carbon',<br>
     'TARGET_LINKER'&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;: 'mac-cfm'<br>
    </small></font> <br>
    Running umake still creates an AppleScript file named Makefile. Makefile
used   to launch CodeWarrior and then send Apple Events to it. The Makefile
now writes out the project in CodeWarrior XML format in a file called {module}.xml
in the project_xml directory of the module. The file is then imported into
CodeWarrior. This is faster than the previous  method of sending Apple Events
to CodeWarrior. <br>
  <br>
  The Makefile also generates another xml file called {module}_uber.xml.
It  is used to create an uber-project, the holy grail for Mac developers.
It's  actually one very large CodeWarrior project for the top level app being
built  that contains all its dependent projects. To build an uber-project
(instead  of building individual DLLs and libs) do a custom build with "-t
uber". In  an uber build, only the xml for each project is created. At the
end all the  xml is imported into a large CW project. This takes several
minutes.<br>
    <br>
  <br>
    <br>
    Changes to mac.pcf files:<br>
    <br>
    Specifying CodeWarrior prefs in mac.pcf files is done differently when
 building  on MacOS X. Specify<br>
    the prefs differently for each platform eg.<br>
    <br>
    <big><font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace" size="-1">if os.environ.get('BUILDING_ON_PLATFORM','')
  == 'MacOSX':<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; project.preferences['PPC Linker']['MWLinker_PPC_initname']&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
= "InitEntryPoint"<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; project.preferences['PPC Linker']['MWLinker_PPC_mainname']&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
= ""<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; project.preferences['PPC Linker']['MWLinker_PPC_termname']&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
= "TermEntryPoint"<br>
    else:<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; project.preferences['PPC Linker']['Initialization
Name']   = '"InitEntryPoint"'<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; project.preferences['PPC Linker']['Main Name']&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
= '""'<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; project.preferences['PPC Linker']['Termination Name']&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
= '"TermEntryPoint"'<br>
    <br>
    </font><big><font size="-1"><big>Look at the &lt;SETTINGS&gt; section
of  the project.xml file to find the correct name of the pref key.<br>
    <br>
    </big></font></big><font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace" size="-1"><br>
