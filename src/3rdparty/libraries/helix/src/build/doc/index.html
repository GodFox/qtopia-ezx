        <h3>What is Ribosome?</h3>
    </div>
    
    <div id="description">
        Ribosome is a suite of build tools, written mainly in Python, which 
        provide a common interface to retrieving and building programs from 
        source code stored in a CVS repository. All Helix products are built
        using the Ribosome tools.
    </div>
    
    <div id="description">       
        Ribosome is composed of two main tools and several helper tools:
        <ul>
            <li>Main Tools:
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="code">build</span> - This tool calculates 
                    the dependencies of a target, retrieves the source code, 
                    and runs commands to build that source code in the correct 
                    order.
                    </li>
                    
                    <li><span class="code">umake</span> - A cross-platform 
                    Makefile generator. <span class="code"> umake</span> can be
                    used independently from <span class="code">build</span> to 
                    generate Makefiles, but <span class="code">build</span> 
                    will call <span class="code">umake</span> during its 
                    operation.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        <ul>

    </div>
    
    <div id="description">
        <ul>
            <li>Helper Tools:
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="code">armerge</span> - Merges static 
                    libraries into a single library.</li>
                    
                    <li><span class="code">gethash.exe</span> - Checks DLL's 
                    for drm signing.</li>
                    
                    <li><span class="code">mkdepend</span> - Generates header 
                    dependency information for Makefiles (similar to 
                    makedepend).</li>

                    <li><span class="code">pyar</span> - On POSIX systems, 
                    creates libarary archive files.</li>
                    
                    <li><span class="code">pylink</span> - Links DLLs and 
                    intelligently assigns preferred load addresses.</li>
           
                    <li><span class="code">rebase.py</span> - Reassigns base
                    addresses to all the DLL's in a directory subtree. Useful 
                    during rebuilds where some DLL's change size but we don't 
                    relink everything.</li>

                    <li><span class="code"><a href="https://ribosome.helixcommunity.org/2005/devdocs/FuncLevelLinking">rlink.py</a>
                    </span> - Perform function-level linking on gcc platforms.
                    </li>

                    <li><span class="code">sign</span> - With proper 
                    permissions, requests signing for a file. Internal RN tool
                    only.</li>
            
                    <li><span class="code">testdriver.py</span> - Runs Ribosome 
                    unit tests.</li>
