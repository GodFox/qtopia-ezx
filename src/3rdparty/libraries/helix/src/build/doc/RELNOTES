Ribosome v2.4.5 
===============

  Release version:  2.4.5
  Release date:     07 February 2007
  Repository:       cvs.helixcommunity.org:/cvsroot/ribosome/build
  Branch:           HEAD
  Tag:              ribosome-2_4_5
  
  What's New
  ==========
  
    * New build option for VC8 builds, "-t embed_manifest". Embeds the managed
      code XML manifest into the binary (exe/dll).
      See: http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms235591(VS.80).aspx        
    
    * Temporarily silenced log messages from going to stdout when the log 
      object has not been properly initialized. This is a work-around until
      necessary fixes can be made in internal automation.

    * Added support for new platforms: FreeBSD-7.0 (still in development),
      linux-2.2-libc6-armv5te-cross-gcc3.3-ixp4xx-softfloat,
      linux-2.6-glibc24-gcc41-i486-lsb, wince-500-ppc-armxs-intel.
      
    * Bugs:
    
      - 5112: Extended the list of "fatal" errors to avoid excessive retries
        when checking out from CVS.
      
      - 5655: Changed the version module to allow text characters after the last
        version number to be incoporated as addendum information
        (e.g: 2.4.4c1 becomes 2.4.4-c1).

        
        
Ribosome v2.4.4
===============

  Release version:  2.4.4
  Release date:     22 August 2006
  Repository:       cvs.helixcommunity.org:/cvsroot/ribosome/build
  Branch:           HEAD
  Tag:              ribosome-2_4_4
  
  What's New
  ==========
  
    * Added support for new symbian platforms: symbian-s60-32-winscw-emulator, 
      symbian-s60-32-armv5, and symbian-s60-32-mmp.
      
    * Turned on Windows Media support in helix-client-all-defines.
    
    * Added DLLOnlyTarget() to force DLL targets even when 'nodll' or 'static'
      build option is used.          
    
    * Bugs:
    
      - 5167: Fixed umake tool break, introduced in 2.4.1. Umake.py will now 
        work properly again when called from command line.
      
      - 5244: Work-around for crashes when globbing on paths with a string like 
        [clien-restricted] (the offensive string containing a '-' between '[' 
        and ']'). The core issue is in invoking python's glob.glob() method 
        with metacharacters ('[',']') in the string.



Ribosome v2.4.3
===============

  Release version:  2.4.3
  Release date:     3 August 2006
  Repository:       cvs.helixcommunity.org:/cvsroot/ribosome/build
  Branch:           HEAD
  Tag:              ribosome-2_4_3
  
  What's New
  ==========
  
    * Bugs:
    
      - Fixed symbian changes from 2.4.2 to work with product branches in
        addition to HEAD.
      
      - Fixed project.addSignOption(): now works with multi-word values and 
        values containing the colon (:) character (useful for using URL's as 
        values).
        

        
Ribosome v2.4.2
===============

  Release version:  2.4.2
  Release date:     20 July 2006
  Repository:       cvs.helixcommunity.org:/cvsroot/ribosome/build
  Branch:           HEAD
  Tag:              ribosome-2_4_2
  
  What's New
  ==========
  
    * Added support for generating MMP files for Symbian build system using
      the umake.py tool by using SYSTEM_ID 'symbian-91-mmp'.
      
    * When using the '-U' option (umake_only), Ribosome will no longer try to
      MD5-sign "output" binaries.
            
    * Bugs:
   
      - Fixed a bug related to thread switching and Python's non-atomic 
        handling of its internal print statement, which could result in 
        intermingled output lines.
         
      - Replaced incorrect HELIX_FEATURE_NO_XWINDOWS with the correct macro,
        HELIX_CONFIG_NO_XWINDOWS, in linux-2.2-libc6-iwmmxt-xscale.cf
      
      

Ribosome v2.4.1
===============

  Release version:  2.4.1
  Release date:     6 July 2006
  Repository:       cvs.helixcommunity.org:/cvsroot/ribosome/build
  Branch:           HEAD
  Tag:              ribosome-2_4_1
  
  What's New
  ==========

    * Ribosome now *ENFORCES* Python 2.4.3, and will abort if run against a
      lesser version.
      
    * Many tools in bin\ have a new name, (build|build.bat ==> build.py;
      umake|umake.bat ==> umake.py, etc), and all "bin" tools will end in .py 
      from now on.
      
    * Signing: the new 'sign.py' tool has been re-enabled, and extends/replaces
      the old 'drmsign' tool.
      
    * Improved the log directory logic. Users can now set RIBOSOME_LOGDIR to
      specify the location, or the Ribosome tools will determine a
      RIBOSOME_LOGDIR (<cwd>\ribosome_logs) at initial bootstrap, and all logs 
      for all child Ribosome processes will go to the same location. 
      (Previously, logs were going to <cwd>\build_logs where <cwd> was the dir 
      any given tool was invoked in.)
      
    * Dropped support for CodeWarrior Mac builds.
      
    * Bugs:
      
      * Fixed problems with too much barf on the screen for tools that were 
        failing to init the log system properly (pylink, for example). 
        All tools now boot up consistently and have standardized log init, 
        error handling, etc.



Ribosome v2.4
=============

  Release version:   2.4
  Release date:      19 June 2006
  Repository:        cvs.helixcommunity.org:/cvsroot/ribosome/build
  Branch:            HEAD
  Tag:               ribosome-2_4
  

  What's New
  ==========

    * Ribosome now requires Python 2.4.3
    
    * Umake:
        
        * AddSources() no longer fatals if target is not present.
        
        * New directive: NonObjectTarget(). Specifies that a target is going to
          be built using only a compiler tool (no linker).
          
        * Added libpath handling directives [addLibpaths(), getLibpaths(),
          removeLibpaths()] to manipulate library paths (currently, win32
          only).
          
        * Added a compiler for .wsdl/soap files.
        
    * New tools:
    
        * rebase.py - Reassign the base addresses of all DLL's in a specified
          directory subtree.
          
        * gethash.exe - Determine if a file is drmsigned (win32 only).

    * Bugs:
    
        * 4833: Fix mkdepend for cross compiling. We have reverted to using the
          python version of mkdepend for all platforms, since the C version was
          not significantly faster.
          
Deprecation Notices:

    These items have all been tagged as deprecated and will be removed in 
    version 3.0:            
                
    * project.target_type: This attribute of the project data should not be 
      getting accessed directly; use a umake Target directive instead. If 
      you need to query the target type, use project.getTargetType().
            
    * AddDebugOutput(): All output functionality in Ribosome is being 
      converted to the new-style logging. See the documentation in log.py 
      for details on using the new logging interface.

    * The following methods had been marked as deprecated for an unknown 
      period of time, and have been officially marked for final removal:    
      * SetBuildVersion()
      * SetBuild2002Version()
      * AddExportedFunctions()
