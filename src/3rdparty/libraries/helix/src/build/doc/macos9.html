<head><title>Build System Installation for MacOS 8-9</title></head>
<body bgcolor="#ffffff">

<h1>Macintosh Installation</h1>

<p>The build system requires MacOS >= 8.6.  Earlier versions behave badly.
<p>
Required tools:
<ul>
  <li>MetroWerks 5.3 Compiler (our own version with modified headers)</li>
  <li>Python 2.1.1</li>
  <li>Python Extension OSAm</li>
  <li>Python Extension StuffIt</li>
  <li>StuffIt Engine (special version, goes with Python StuffIt)</li>
  <li>MacCVS Pro 2.5 beta 2</li>
  <li>AkauSweets AppleScript extension</li>
  <li>ResManip AppleScript extension (our own, lost the source)</li>
  <li>RMA Build Prefs file in System Folder:Preferences:</li>
  <li>build module from CVS (cvs checkout build from /home/source)</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>The two Python extensions, OSAm and StuffIt, need to be copied into the
<i>:Mac:Plugins</i> folder of the Python 2.1 installation.  The AppleScript
extensions, AkauSweets and ResManip, need to be copied into
<i>System Folder:Scripting Additions</i>.  There is a copy of the
<b>StuffIt</b> engine which works with the StuffIt Python extension,
but you can probably use whatever <b>StuffIt</b> came with your Mac.</p>

<p>One thing missing on the Macintosh is environment variables.  The are
simulated with a preferences file, <i>RMA Build Prefs</i>, that needs to
be created in <i>System Filer:Preferences</i>. Here is a example:</p>

<p><b>Example</b>(RMA Build Prefs):
<pre>
## Sample RMA Build Prefs
## Environment Variables:
##   BUILD_ROOT: The path to the build system.
##   SOURCE_ROOT: The path to where you want to checkout/build source code.
##   BUILD_SW: The path to the CodeWarrior IDE.
##   MACCVS_PATH: The path to the MacCVS Pro program.
##   CVSSESSION_PATH: The path to the MacCVS Pro session file you created.
 
os.environ = {
"BUILD_ROOT" : "MacOS:dev:build",
"SOURCE_ROOT" : "MacOS:dev:src",
"BUILD_SW" : '"MacOS:CodeWarrior Pro 5:MetroWerks CodeWarrior: CodeWarrior IDE 4.0.4"',
"MACCVS_PATH" : '"MacOS:dev:tools:MacCVS"',
"CVSSESSION_PATH" : '"MacOS:dev:cvssession"'
}
</pre>
</p>

<p>Now you need to compile two Python scripts in the build system in Python
applets.  This is done using the <i>Build Applet</i> tool in the Python install
directory.  Drag <i>build:bin:build</i>, and <i>build:bin:umake</i> onto
<i>Build Applet</i>.  For each applet created, you will need to increase the
memory to about 20MB.  After the applets are created, they can be moved onto
the desktop, or wherever else you like to keep them.  Double-click on the
<i>build</i> applet to start the build system, or drag and drop 
<i>Umakefil</i>s onto the <i>umake</i> applet to generate individual
makefiles.  The makefiles are AppleScript, and can be run easily by the
<i>Script Editor</i>.</p>
