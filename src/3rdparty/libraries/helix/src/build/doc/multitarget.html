<h1>Multi-Target Umake files</h1>
<hr>

<p>A Top-level Umakefil defines sub-targets in the module with the statement:</p>
<pre>
MultiTargetMake("target1", "target2", ...)
</pre>

<p>In addition to this, you can optionally call UseCommonObjects() before
the MutiTargetMake() call.  UseCommonObjects() is a optimization hint
which tells Umake it can use object files which may have been compiled
by one of the other targets instead of compiling a separate copy.
This can only be used if you are sure the objects from the two targets
are compiled identically.  This means the same defines, include paths, 
etc.</p>
<pre>
TODO: add something to multi-target specification to define what platforms
      a target builds on; the problem with this is we will have
      platform/target determination in two locations, the BIF file and
      the Umakefil which isn't good either
</pre>

<p>Instead of listing *.pcf files in the Umakefil, the new MultiTargetMake
acts more like single target Umake.  Let's review how single target
Umake works for a target.  When Umake is invoked, a series of .pcf files
are executed, ending with the Umakefil itself.  The .pcf files are
determined by the platform Umake is being run on.  Under 
linux-2.0-libc6-i386, the following files would be executed, if they exist:</p>
<ol>
  <li>unix.pcf</li>
  <li>linux.pcf</li>
  <li>linux2.pcf</li>
  <li>Umakefil</li>
</ol>

<p>The old multi-target make syntax made it impossible to emulate 
this .pcf file execution behavior for sub-targets.  This is now fixed.
MultiTargetMake("target1", "target2") would exec the following .pcf files:</p>
<ol>
  <li>unix.pcf</li>
  <li>target1_unix.pcf</li>
  <li>linux2.pcf</li>
  <li>target1_linux2.pcf</li>
  <li>all.pcf</li>
  <li>target1</li>
  <li>unix.pcf</li>
  <li>target2_unix.pcf</li>
  <li>linux2.pcf</li>
  <li>target2_linux2.pcf</li>
  <li>all.pcf</li>
  <li>target2</li>
</ol>
   
<p>Remember these files are not mandatory -- the are only executed
if they are there.</p>

<p>You no longer have to list out the .pcf files for execution.  The .pcf 
file names are the same as those used in single-target Umake, except
for the <b>targetname</b>_ prepended to them.  Notice the single-target .pcf
files are also executed for each target.  This is a mechanism for keeping
platform data global to all the targets in one place.</p>

<p>The new "all.pcf" file is executes for all sub-targets, no matter what
platform you are on.  It's there to help keep only a single copy of 
data which otherwise may have to be replicated in both the "target1" and
"target2" umake files.</p>

<p>If you want to want to know what files will be executed for a particular
platform, look in the build/umake/*.cf files.  Near the top of the file,
there's a line:</p>
<pre>
platform.pcf_prefix_list = [ ... ]
</pre>

<p>This lists the .pcf file execution in the correct order.  There are no
problems adding to this list for a particular platform.  For example,
the linux-2.0-libc6-i386 platform has:</p>
<pre>
platform.pcf_prefix_list = ['unix', 'linux2']
</pre>

<p>It may make be necessary to add "linux-i386" to all Linux/i386 platforms
to include some set of assembly objects.</p>
