    <div id="section">
        <h3>Python 2.4.3</h3>
    </div>
    
    <div id="description">We wrote the build system in Python because of its 
    excellent portability, and ease of maintenance.  Python code has a "cleaner"
    look to it than Perl, and the C API is easy to use.  We have decided to
    start trailing Python development and stay current to the most recent stable
    branch. As such, Ribosome now requires Python version <b>2.4.3</b>.

    <div id="description">If you've never seen Python code before, here's an example of a simple
    program that counts the integers from 0 to 5:</div>
    <pre>
    def print_count(n):
        for i in range(n+1):
            print i
    
    print_count(5)
    </pre>
