    <h4>Ribosome v2.4</h4>
    
    <div id="description">
        This API documentation covers the current version of Ribosome's umake
        tool. Methods marked with a version specify what minimum version of 
        Ribosome is required to get that feature. Methods without any version
        were available in v2.3. Deprecation warnings are also listed for those
        items that are scheduled for removal.

        All umake files should start with a call to 
        <span class="code">UmakefileVersion()</span>,
        this will tell the build system how to interpret the contents
        of the umake file in a way that is backwards compatible.
        When creating a new umake file, you should use the version
        of the build system you are currently using. This documentation
        was written for build 2.2 which means that you should use
        <span class="code">UmakefileVersion(2,2)</span> in order to get the
        build system to behave as described here.

        Currently, project is a global object that represents the data for the

        within this object that have been presented and are directly accessible. 
        This leads to some pretty ugly coupling and difficult paths to umake 
        enhancement. At some point in the future, this style of accessing 
        project data and methods directly is going to go away completely in 
        favor of a more clearly defined (and hopefully simpler) umake API.

    <div id="description">
        This method links against a library created by the build system.
        Each argument should be the name of the module containing that library.
        If the module is in a subdirectory, / can be used to specify the name.
        If the name of the library is not the same as the directory it is in,
        you can append [libname] to specify the name of the library.
    
        <p>Examples: (where "release" is sometimes replaced with "debug")
        <div id="example">
            project.AddModuleLibrary("pnmisc") # Link against pnmisc/release/pnmisc.lib<br>
            project.AddModuleLibrary("foo/bar") # Link against foo/bar/release/bar.lib<br>
            project.AddModuleLibrary("foo/bar[gazonk]") # Link against foo/bar/release/gazonk.lib<br>
        </div>
        
        When executing <span class="code">AddModuleLibraries</span>, umake will 
        also look for a file called
        <span class="code">[module]/[libraryname]_linkhook.cf</span> and execute it 
        if present. This allows the module to add include paths and other magic 
        so that the library users don't have to think about it.

        <p>Examples:
        <div id="example">
            project.AddModuleLibrary("pnmisc") # Executes pnmisc/pnmisc_linkhook.cf<br>
            project.AddModuleLibrary("foo/bar") # Executes foo/bar/bar_linkhook.cf<br>

        This function allows you to manually do what

        This is the list of features you can turn on using this function:
        <dl>
        <dt> submodules
        <dd> This will enable multi-target umake files to cd into the
             directory where a submodule is located instead of trying
             to execute it from the current working directory.
        </dl>
        
        <dt> versioning_off
        <dd> This will turn off name mangling for DLLs on most platforms.
             Normally *.ver files are used to create a versioned filename
             for DLLs, but with this feature. (Which is on by default if
             you use <tt>UmakeFileVersion(2,1)</tt> or greater)

        This function takes an environment variable and a relative
        path as arguments. If the environment variable exists, a
        link to/alias to/copy of the output will be placed in that
        directory. Example:
        
        <div id="example">
            project.AddDebugOutput("RP_DEBUG_BASEDIR","plugins/rv/")

        This will copy the output into $RP_DEBUG_BASEDIR/plugins/rv/
        Since the paths are often platform specific, this functions
        should normally only be used in pcf files.
        <p>
        NOTA BENE:<br>
        The rel_path arguments *must* end with a slash if it

        This will tell umake to check in the library/dll/program generated by
        this umakefile into the location given by 'location'. The location
        is relative to the source root and must be a directory which has a
        <a href=bif.html#checkin_dependlist>&lt;checkin_dependlist&gt;</a>
        from this module.
        <p/>
        <p>
        The location should be given using one of the named parameters
        <span class="code">release, debug</span> or <span class="code">any</span>.
        If you use the <span class="code">release</span> parameter, then the 
        checkin will only be performed if this is a release build.
        </p>
        <p>
        The location can use brackets to specify the location and name of the
        library, a few examples to illustrate. For simplicity, I will assume
        that project.SetDistLocation was used in a LibraryTarget umakefile.        
        <div id="example">
            project.SetDistLocation(release="foo/bar[../gazonk]")
        </div>
        This will check in the library as 'gazonk'. It will be checked in
        at the top level so that the distribution will be shared by both
        debug and release builds using this dist. If this is a debug build,
        then nothing will happen.

        <div id="example">
            project.SetDistLocation(debug="foo/bar[./gazonk]")
        </div>
        This will check in the library as 'gazonk'. It will be checked in
        into the debug directory of the foo/bar module, but only if this is a
        debug build, otherwise nothing will happen.

        <div id="example">
            project.SetDistLocation(any="foo/bar[./gazonk]")
        </div>
        This will check in the library as 'gazonk'. It will be checked in
        into the release/debug directory depending on what kind of build
        this is.
        
        <div id="example">
            project.SetDistLocation("foo/bar")
        </div>
        This will check in the library as 'foo'.
        It will search the foo/bar directory to see if the library
        already exists, and if it does check it into the same place.
        If it does not exist, it will be checked in into the
        debug/release directory as approperiate. However, no checkin
        will take place if this is a debug build.
